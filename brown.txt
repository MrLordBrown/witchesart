Adjunct personnel Holly Brenner stood upon the 2nd -tier landing surrounding the observation deck, her camera darting in seemingly random fits like a gracious fly at a summer barbeque. Though it had been decades since professional cameras had used mechanical lenses, she opted to turn on the digital sound reproduction option in a never-known grasp at nostalgia. In her time, satellites were accurate enough to capture each tweezer pull of someone plucking their eyebrows, in the dark, with stunning clarity. Public video feeds were common and ubiquitous in all aspects of daily life. She liked to imagine her ancestors of old, cameras saddled about the neck and ever at the ready to capture that one moment that could never be caught again. When everything is being captured at all times, why manually photograph. Holly believed it was not the actual moment to capture anymore but its impact on those lucky enough to witness it. Thus, she found herself alone on the landing where there is no view of the world from which they were soon to depart, mimicking the sounds of a time near forgotten, capturing the reactions of those who would say goodbye to the only home they ever knew.At a compact five-feet and one-inch in height, Holly was a short young woman by any definition. She liked to credit it as one of the properties of her buoyant personality and the equally bouncing manner by which she moved. She wore a flat, seafoam-colored skirt that ended just above her cotton, white socks and auto-balancing sneakers that allowed her to nimbly ‘chase faces’ without fear of twisting an ankle. Her blouse was white with tiny, also seafoam lightbulbs evenly embroidered throughout. She decided that day was a special sort of occasion and thus matching bra and panties were in order, also seafoam in color, and totally in contrast to her usual roll-out-of-bed, forget-the-bra-or-panties-or-both ritual she performed each morning. Her hair was dark castaneous and cut in a bob that flirted with her shoulders. She completed her departure-day garb with the arm cuff and lanyard required for all UEC personnel.She smiled at the expressions of the people on the observation deck. There were those who were crying, some apprehensive, and some beaming with joy. She heard the now-familiar sound of the pneumatic hinges activate on the door behind her and turned to see who might be joining her to collect the faces of the crowd.She reeled and her mouth fell agape at the man she saw. He was an almost exact copy of her mentor and adoptive father, Sato.The young man quickly moved through the door and to the railing, he lifted an eyepiece and peered through it, looking up at the lighting above the observation deck.'Kuso!' he barked with a hint of a growl while turning to exit before catching Holly’s frozen glare.'Can I help you.' he asked, slightly irritated but not without manners.'Iie . . . atashiwa . . . dake . . .' she quickly turned and hid behind her camera, snapping pointless pictures of the crowd, 'gomenasai!' She concluded in embarrassment.'Well well, you speak Japanese.' He approached with curiosity.'Hai, yes, mostly, I do.' Holly replied without removing her eye from the camera.'Sugoi! I’m Yosuke, I work in the media department, chief lighting engineer.' He exclaimed and put his thumb through his suspenders and flexed them with pride. 'Although, honestly, what does that even mean.' He thought about it for a moment.'Hajimemashite. I am Aki, eh, Holly.' She moved from the camera to see this boy who could have been her second father’s doppelganger. Her eyes were wide and her bottom lip quivered ever so slightly to notice.'The media department, yeah me too.' She said unintelligibly while continuing to stare.'Nani. What have I got some cheese Danish on my face or something.' He wiped around his mouth and checked his hand.'Crap, I have to go, there’s a fixture that is . . . but hey, nice meeting you Aki and I’ll see you around, okay. Mata ne!' He was out the door and Holly stood there with a bewildered look having creeped across her face.‘Ja, mata ne.’Holly looked over the crowd with the inexplicable shock of meeting Yosuke beginning to fade. It was like seeing a ghost although she had only last seen her second father that morning. It took months of mental preparation for Holly to gather the strength to leave him behind and although she did not suspect that he would pass while she was gone, the thought of losing another father was dreadful.Holly was not quick to surprise, either. She spent much of her youth running scams and cons throughout the various foster homes she shuffled through and the accompanying schools they garnered. The police knew her by name; so did the drug dealers, vandals, thieves, and would-be pimps that were all too common and ignored in the middle- and high-schools of the day. Sato saved her from that life and as she looked towards the stars at the vastness of her next beginning, she was profoundly grateful.Looking across the revelry and excitement of the crowd Holly’s lens finds a girl bouncing up and down like a child at the gates to an amusement park, her too alone on the landing across the observation deck.'It is a joy to see the joy in others; it is in their joy that we may see our own.' A strong, resonant voice quotes from behind Holly.'The joy of others is yours.' She completes the phrase as she snaps a photo of the jubilant girl now heading down to the crowded observation deck.It took Holly a moment to realize that someone was behind her and she spun around to meet a distinctly imposing figure. The man was built like an oak tree, tall and full of 90-degree angles. He was an older man but she got the sense that his looks defied his age like he was probably 563 years old but looked a dashing 62. His piercing, narrow gaze made it tough to determine if he was looking in front of him or somewhere far into the future. Holly then noticed his arm band and the word 'Captain' inscribed upon it. She bounced to attention, not exactly sure what she was supposed to do being part of the crew but not an official astronaut.'Well then, you are a Robertson fan as well, I see.' Captain James Lightspeed as he towered over the girl, hands crossed behind his back. He referenced the poet and scholar Jamil Robertson, known for his lengthy and at times blisteringly opinionated writings on social interaction, group thinking, and cultural control.'Yes sir, he is one of my father’s favorite satirists and commentators.' Holly stared at her captain and she was reminded of General Sherman and the towering sequoias of Central California. She imagined he could crush her into a ball and blow her out of a straw with the ease of a mischievous schoolboy, except she would be blown through the wall and not simply into the back of little Johnny’s head.'Then your father has exceptional taste. In my opinion, most misinterpret what he was saying there and that’s likely the point. It is not that the joy of others is our responsibility so that we should be selfless but that if we step back and observe, we can siphon our own joy from others; like a vampire who drinks happiness.'Holly was no stranger to all-night, philosophical musings and did not miss the irony or coincidence between the quote and her photographic study in reactions.'If that is the case, sir, then this is the blood bank.' She motioned the camera about her neck and they both smile widely.'Indeed, that would be a fact!' The Captain replied and followed with a fit of hardy, jovial laughter. 'You are probably wondering why I am having a lively literary discussion with an adjunct photographer as opposed to making final preparations for launch or handing out small talk and shakes or giving a speech to embolden the crew and passengers.' He looked down to her with his eyes that when caught for a moment, traipsing delicately behind years of hard work, training, and leading, expressed a soft kindness that urged you readily to a state of peace and calm.'I think it is because your happiness comes from seeing their happiness.' She looked back towards the crowd.'Precisely, Miss Brenner. It’s good to know that there are sharp minds like yours aboard, which helps me sleep a little better. Good day.' He gently bowed and left through the door directly behind her.Holly was again struck by the strangeness of the situation. ‘First Yosuke and now the captain of the ship,’ she pondered, ‘and he knows my name.’Holly took note of the warning lights throughout the deck indicating that the engine had been turned on. There was no sound to be heard from it; something to do with perpetual motion and protons and some other science that she didn’t really understand.She snapped a few more reactions, capturing the rapture of the few who were excited for the engine to start. She readied to leave the landing towards the observers when something was caught in her peripheral vision. It looked like fog or steam yet moved with purpose and was illuminated with a soft, indigo hue. Holly gasped and her heart leapt at the sight of the apparition. She turned towards it and instinctually lifted her camera. Through the lens she gleaned an impossible sight; a figure that looked vaguely humanoid, with no arms and a single trailing leg moved through the crowd, the fog of its presence sticking like dryer lint and static on those it passed. She trembled violently and grasped the camera as if it were the only means of holding her upright. Her teeth clenched, grinded and a sliver of a high frequency ring echoed in each of her ears. The figure stopped; Holly froze in a spasm of fear. The outer lens of her camera exploded into a mist of fine glass; Holly screamed a pitch that was nearly inaudible to humans as she bolted through the door and onto the primary ring hall. There was no thought or consideration of her movement, direction, or speed; terror impressed a simple directive upon her to distance herself as far away from that fog as quickly as possible.She made a right into a door that’s color would be known as lavender but one that she had never seen before. All was gray and always had been to her at that moment. The door opened and she stepped into a bathroom. Her footsteps sounded like the muffled thuds of a pillow attacking a punching bag. The bathroom was brilliant in white such that a shadow could not be found. The door opened into the mist of the sanitation scrubber, beyond where three stalls, lightly decorated in white and and various sizes of lavender-colored flowers, an automated basin with a UV hand sanitizer, a wash basin, and a micro cyclonic hand dryer, and a baby changing float attached to a magnetic cuff on the wall opposite the basin.The flood of white light was blinding to her battered, tear-stung eyes. She swam through the opacity of the fluorescence and found the wash basin, signaling it on for cold water. In the mirror above the basin Holly peered and saw herself as something of a mottled, dissolving stuffed animal from a kid’s early-age educational stream as her eyes continued to adjust to the light. This made her chuckle a bit and sparked the process of calming.'Baka. Dame. Damn girl, get it together.' She stared at herself and offered admonishment. 'It’s not real. It can’t be real, remember.''I am Holly Brenner,' she sniffled with increasing clarity, 'I am an adjunct photographer with the media department. I am aboard the Ever Onward to enhance the humanity of the automated recording system, provide art and photography instruction to those who may seek it, and to carry out the will of the captain as he sees fit.' She held up her lanyard up to the mirror and continued to stare at herself, her tears all but gone and her beaming smile returned.'I am Holly Brenner.'Holly blinked a couple times and then lifted her head from the cold bathroom floor. The unfamiliarity of the stall caught her by surprise; a sterile box, unappreciative of the young girl’s disorientation. She hurried to her feet and glanced around the bathroom, looking for anything, something, or nothing. Mirrors, sink, a janitor’s closet, soft white lights; Holly’s accounting balanced everything in order. She burst through the bathroom door, satisfied that she had not harmed herself or engaged in any sort of property damage, and set her tiny legs to sprint towards her room.Her mind was still in a fog, ‘drowning’ as she called it, the aftermath of her narcolepsy. It is a similar feeling when one sleeps for an excessive amount of time, her circadian rhythms syncopate out of beat, leaving her groggy. She was thinking of Yosuke, and the Captain, and the dark image from her imagination. Her preoccupation drove her straight into an unsuspecting Dr. Evy Chayka as she was exiting Holly’s room. Dr. Chayka lost her footing as Holly crashed body first into her legs, causing her to fall chest first and flat on top of Holly who met the same demise by 180 degrees.'Well then, I suppose the odds are not in my favor for a smooth departure.' Evy ponders as she collects herself from the floor.'Oh, oh, I am so so sorry.' Holly rolls over in her garment of sweat and dread to meet the quartermaster . She springs from the floor to help Evy up.'I just, just had to get her because I was asleep and the bathroom . . .' Holly spoke a jigsaw puzzle of an excuse.'It is quite alright miss, I think everyone has something of a butterfly or two clamoring in their bellies.' Dr. Chayka smoothed a few wrinkles from her uniform and looked at Holly.'Is there something the matter miss. You look like you’ve seen a ghost.''Me. No no, I am fine, just a bit . . you know . . .' Holly had no intention of laying out the details of her narcolepsy or the creature she imagined on the observation deck.'But you, you are fine, right. How are you doing, mam.' Holly wanted to bite her tongue off at the unintelligible word search that just left her mouth.'I am not injured but I am intrigued.' She examines Holly with a calculating eye.'Oh that’s just me, Holly the intriguing, always getting intrigued on.' She smiled and hoped that Dr. Chayka would just ignore her use of ‘intrigued’.'Yes, I suppose you may, Holly. I suggest you rest.' Dr. Chayka started towards the next room and turned back to give Holly another inquisitive look before shaking her head and continuing her rounds.Holly walked into her room and fell to the bed like it was the sole source of gravity in the universe. She clapped her hands to her face in a rich snap of embarrassment.'Holly the Intriguing,' she said out loud.There is a number and it is 120 billion; give or take a million. That number is the government’s official estimate as to the collective of ghosts that wander the humming buzz of tunnels that form the skeletal sprawl of Yomekrop.ini and the endless abyss beyond its boundary. It is the only city and by the word of the It.e, the best of its kind. The government agrees but then again what do they know. They form a special gang of energy wiffers and slight chatters bent on hoarding information and junking know-it-alls while doing so in full view of those who would be junked, tits and all.You learn to count before you really know you are stepping, then you are shuffled from the Tretis Light to the education dorm. Shuffled like that ugly ghost you bent sideways behind the hub and hope to forget by filing her in the back of your little black infodex. She wasn’t a looker but she sure could hum. After the authorities stabilize your frequency and shove enough info into your gapping craw to elevate you to just-better-than-useless, the real fun begins. You get mangled with a hump of other listless transients into the nearest tunnel and fed to the gnawing multiplexing of Yome. With a vagary of certainty, I swear I heard some tre. yell 'Good luck, sucker' when I was evacuated into the glowing, wavering faculties of the city.I can see the pulsing, endless séance of arriving ghosts and busy little government coordinators from the 257th level of my regular block near the high-capacity hex tunnel, Doma.nika. Peering towards the origin point, a tiny and sadistically familiar energy scape bears its vibrant flux before me. The tunnel sheds fits of light as ghosts make travel for a routine or leisure or scandal. The other side of the tunnel is a collage of information hubs, resting blocks, art installations, performance venues, and vendor skiffs. The energy of the city generally excites with a green hue and countless steps have been taken to standout by generating frequencies with different colors. Further still is the city wall, the only government facility in Yome that isn’t green. It lulls in a soft blue, as if trying to convince a would-be trespasser into stasis. After that, black as far as you can see. The darkness beyond the final vestiges of blue from the city wall appears dense and sentient. The utter expanse of emptiness beacons for anomalous visions and imagined machinations to calm the mind of psychosis. It is in that heavy, lumbering black that the components of malice and eternity are compounded into chaos through the wicked chemistry of forever.120 billion here and an infinity there; at this step, four ghosts shine slightly brighter than others on this eternal canvas. One shines brighter than all, a specter named Opal. Opal finds herself locked in stasis in Stasis Block Kre.t, her thoughts and meddling flagged as unavoidably dangerous by the government with cause to end further travel and silence her intent. Yet, in a place where God is asleep at the wheel, Fate has a chance to take the reigns.A small skiff outside Stasis Block Kre.t is the playing field for a game of chance encounter. The skiff is a Morphist information float, peddling propaganda about the life before Yome and the denigrations that make for an eternal existence in the city. A long traveled phantom finds herself here at the behest of the nagging whispers from under the hum of the city light. The enthusiastic ghost on-boarder at far but nearer than ever. The small creature that moves by four and moves by dark, followed an internal compass towards an unknown magnetism.As for me; here is a bit of ghost humor: I am nobody.'Hey, grunty, get over here.'Gog’s ears perked up and he swung his compact chunkiness around to see a sort-of lady peering from the floating kiosk just outside the prison.'You talking to me lady.' Gog yells back at the lady like a homeless person with a political agenda and a cardboard sign yells at traffic.'Shhhh, quiet down sniffy, you don’t need any more trouble than you already in.' She sneaks back over the counter and beacons once more. She moves like a spider, each gnawing claw of her wretched feet and each fingernail of her twisted fingers calculated to provide optimal balance for fight or flight. She wears what looks like the coif of a nuns habit, illuminated in a cutting, brilliant white. Her energy is also stark but vibrates rapidly and erratically, causing wrinkles and fissures to appear throughout her body.'The name is Gog and I ain’t interested in no morphist juju magic or whatever you tossing back there lady.' The four legged void moderates his volumes and takes a few steps towards the skiff.As Gog approaches the info keeper her frequency begins oscillating inconsistently, causing her form to stretch and bend.'Enough!' She shrikes and her voice causes their surroundings to dim, 'that is quite enough. You may not be interested in this but I know you are interested in getting inside there.'The lady pivots her arm 215 degrees to point at Stasis Block Kre.t behind her while continuing to stare at Gog.'You can tell you friend to join us, wouldn’t want to leave anyone out of the fun.' She smiles and flicks her talons, causing Lyath to materialize.Stasis Block Kre.t includes a research wing not unlike most prisons of its kind. The stations and fixtures that combine into the skeleton of this wing include the usual frequency generators, communications signatures, equipment registrations, and government-issued protocols that are common for such a facility. Amongst the bones of this skeleton are a variety of ghosts whose eternal course finds them moving in and out of various explorations into the nature of Yome and the vast darkness of beyond.There is one whose explorations look beyond the nature of the eternal vastness of the cosmos.The open lab within the research facility is empty save for government researcher Casn. The wiry phantom paces inquisitively and with great intent in front of eight projection plates. Each one looping a handful of steps from seemingly random locations; the origin point, a nondescript stopping block, a cell in the Deletion Pit, a section of a tunnel, the stasis chamber of a radical ghost designated as Opal. His observational acumen is precise and calculated, slicing razor thin glances in a sharp, decisive dance where some yet-blossomed wallflower of correlation leads and Casn readily follows. This exchange between ghost and phenomenon is swiftly interrupted by a facility-wide notification of buffering activity near the stasis block. Casn expressly ignores the disruption as security is not his concern only to be further disrupted by the appearance of a tunnel exit in the lab.Casn rolls his eyes and turns belligerently towards the clicking, vibrating Mandelbrot set. Consul Huit manifests from within, outfitted in an ultramodern external pattern that stands out as boisterously elegant.'You there, researchist, Consul Alan Huitt,' the ghost announces and smiles genuinely as he immediately moves with hand open to great Casn, 'traveling long for work here I see, fine job, great working.'The two make a circular hand gesture as a greeting and a means of transmitting public information about themselves.'Casn Seg.n.' bitterly.'I see, well than, great to have you onboard, this should be a stellar walk and nonother than the finest this block has to offer I am sure is now accompanying me.'No break in his smile, no depth to his graciousness, no skip in his cadence. Casn wonders if this ghost is for real and then interrupts himself.'Wait, what. No, I am not . . . I don’t accompany . . . I am just an other not the ‘non’ kind of other . . .' He fumbles his speech in Jenga blocks.'Now now, where’s the fun in that.' Consul Huitt goads while considering that he could double up on the Ryzens during the finals and break even.A bewildered Lyath moves from the shadows towards Gog and the two listen to what Fenny has to offer.'How the phased do you bend the ladies anyways there ghost. You ball up and ask for a favor.' Fenny smirks and cackles like the pump from an aquarium filter autotuned to bass.'Magic honey; same way I’m going to bend you over, magic.' Gog replies and eyes over towards Lyath as if saying ‘you can watch, that’s not a problem.’ Lyath feels like sinking three or more levels down and disappearing from the whole exchange.'Well before we get to the pleasantries, there’s a matter of payment.' Fenny is all business in tone and mannerisms.'There is a chunk, down in Filament Sector of the Deletion Pit. You make it out of this place without ending up looking like a piece of fine art, surely you can make it out of the Pit with it, right dreamy.'Fenny eyes Lyath up and down, taking account for the first time, smiling like a dirty pervert by her most ladylike of means.'What are you.' Lyath asks in disgust.'Besides a good time. Whatever may be needing to drop the juicy info where it belongs.' She makes a motion between her legs and then lifts her thumb and fingers to her lips, blowing smoke from her pointer.'Sure thing you gaming behinder, sounds like a swell ride.' Gog interjects, not being the most chivalrous of ghosts but having sense enough to know when senselessness is enough.'Smart!' Fenny accepts. 'Now, there is a vendor skiff lit up like it’s dropping info on keeping your frequency clocking and stasis free. Moves the same length on repeat and it be making its way here in a few paces. But pulling your harmonizer there, it is a transport, bringing the ghosts needing silencing in a silent way to their silent place. You get in that skiff, you have tunnel straight and true. If that doesn’t roll your light bright, then finding out it’s autonomous surely will.' Fenny smiles and floats back into the booth in the middle of the skiff.'Well now lady, you are full of sweetness despite your cranky worn out pattern. I’d say thanks but you won’t hear it anyways.' Gog quips as Fenny hurriedly reappears from the booth.'What’s that.' Fenny says her last words as Gog mocks her with a ‘shhhhhh’ and then alters his frequency to a hissing, cacophonic blend of white noise, screaming, and tired moaning.The resonance from his little frame grows dark and begins absorbing light from all that surrounds him; the vendor skiff, the tunnel and travel markings, and the government installation warnings. As the light leaves these features it leaves a hollow, empty blackness that pierces through the vastness of sight, creating a vacuum of distance that could unhinge the sensibilities of the most traveled and longshadowed of ghosts. A visual queue of the truly incomprehensible length of absolute eternity.The biting synergy of noises grows in volume and then in an instant implodes, erasing all sound from the area for a brief moment. That silence is shattered as the dark energy explodes from within Fenny. In a slowly moving, seemingly calculated instruction the frequencies and patterns that make Fenny any sort of being begin to bend, crack, and splinter, like systematically breaking tubes of neon gas. Each realignment causes Fenny to squeak and hiss and mumble while rapidly gaining momentum, reconfiguring her exponentially in smaller and smaller bits until she is but a floating haze of dark vacuums and slithering blackness. What is left of her coalesces into a tight sphere by a harsh, exacting gravity and then is released in an excited expulsion of darkness and vapor. The vendor skiff she peddled from disintegrates and whatever light that was visible within a block of Gog and Lyath is extinguished for a pace of steps.The light returns just as the skiff she mentioned begins turning the tunnel corner, making its way towards Kre.t.In the darkness of forever, light has a say. The voice and the resonance and the song; therein lies chaos. The calculated iterations towards perfection mingle with the singular assertions of hope. The grinding and cranking cogs and sprockets of the eternity machine chew, salivate, and devour motion. Ethereal punch cards program. Insects and worms pop and ooze; the menstruation of calamity curding in chunky rivulets through teeth and gears.A quintet takes the stage; hopeful Fate pushes ‘all in’. The churning tempest and the pragmatic seeker harmonize in rapid staccato and focused ostinato. The satin of the shadows and the blank sorcery of malice duet; melodies that careen in an atonal progression of dissonant success.The aria manifests from the silence; its timbre the echoes of angels reverberating from the delicate, crystalline barriers between eons and realities and its form the thrusting, grasping power of destruction and ecstasy. A song heard by one as the light says it all.Roughly, think about this, combining the average age of every human who has ever lived equals the estimated lifespan of the solar system that Earth finds itself in. A single lifespan of a ghost in Yome trumps that 8 or 9 billion years as insignificant to the eternity that they face. A single human’s lifespan is 0.0000000083% of the lifespan of the human solar system and the lifespan of a solar system approaches zero percent to that of a single ghost’s lifespan.Now, I’m thinking about the lifespan of our ghosts here in Stasis Block Kre.t. Each one is a battery of infinite potential yet each one believes that maybe things are not so endless. If a ghost comes from somewhere does that not mean they can go somewhere just the same. The researcher finds himself with an open cell and the prisoner Opal, whom he has exerted considerable energy in studying, released by none other than a government authority. Meanwhile, a ghost of tenure finds herself with new power and a ghost of minute stature toys with his companion; they are making quite a team of themselves as they move towards Opal at the heart of the block. They may have to make more of themselves than that as the block begins to fill with government agents and the Warden Te.n becomes alert and ravenous. Opal at the middle of it all, what is she to do as she regains her freedom. Whatever these ghosts choose to do, I have a sinking feeling that Kre.t is unlikely to make it out of this ordeal with much intact.'Slinky deletion slit.' Gog muttered to himself as he shook a couple times to unlatch the lingering vibe of Fenny from his frequency. He was pleased by his undoing of Fenny, something only the most dedicated and relentless of sorcerers can achieve and furthermore a feat only ever considered in the darkest circles of the Void. Void culture is akin to living in a house where everyone hates each other. A cruel fate has bound them, they can only get along by begrudgingly helping each other, and they never talk but they always know what the others are up to. Gog was as sinister as any other Void but his small size made him duly vicious as he used it as part of his arsenal of torment and deceit. He had nothing against Lyath, however, and shuddered at the thought of having to explain to her what he just did and blah blah blah, words and words. So, instead of undoing her just the same he opted to show his warmer side and lead Lyath on an illusory rollercoaster where she would do all the heavy lifting and Gog, the heavy nothing.The prisoner transport approached and Gog conjured up an illusory Fenny to act as their savior in providing passage into the facility. In truth, Lyath grabbed Gog and followed him onto the prisoner transport where it was indeed without authority and without prisoner. Lyath sat and Gog curled up in her lap as the transport opened an outside barrier and the skiff began descending the tunnel into Kre.t. Gog didn’t see much need in blanking much of that from Lyath but he did throw a bit more Fenny into the mix to further mask his undoing of her. The real fun began when the transport ended its descent and two government authorities were present at the entry barrier.Gog thought to himself, ‘waste my energy on these low rung overbenders or let Lyath take care of it. ‘'Sure thing you freaky neck bauble, be my guest.'Gog sensed Lyath might try something silly other than incapacitating the guards so he made it simple on her and presented a high security barrier , just enough strength to make sure she put her full weight on it and thereby upon the guards. She exited the transport and Gog peered through the automated display. The two guards took flight immediately. ‘Specters, of course, how original,’ thought Gog.Lyath appeared to be pantomiming something into the ether, like she was trying to erase some boinker’s mouth and play with his undertones at the same time. Gog began laughing as she confused the guards with her act. They mumbled something about an unauthorized phantom attempting to channel magic at the prisoner entrance but they didn’t make it much past that as Lyath began ‘opening the door’. Gog watched in disbelief as Lyath laid into the two authority like she was stripping info tabs off the free board at the local hub. Then she proceeded to absorb their energy like she was a little ecto siphon . Each of them grew dimmer and dimmer and the familiar hum that any ghost emits began to soften and then silence. The ethereal husks that remained cracked briefly and then evaporated into the dark.Gog spun and yelled 'Big tuggin’ Hand of It. you sassy ‘tom where you pick up that bit of hand waving!' Gog left the transport and ran towards Lyath. Still under his spell, she offered help to pull him through the ‘barrier’ and he obliged by jumping into her arms. The little creature wasn’t at all knowledgeable in the differences between ghosts besides their names and obvious behaviors but he was pretty sure that Phantoms didn’t make a habit of going about and evaporating ghosts into smoke. That kind of power was Void territory but he saw what she did as clear as a hubrubber will catch a wink.'We are going to have a ball of a waltz lady.' He smiled with satisfaction as the thought of the two of them crushing foe after foe and obstacle after obstacle like a pair of armed lady signals suffered his frequency with a charged megalomania.She told him softly to ‘come’ and carried him past the barrier, which to their fortune was not generated due to an oversight by the disappeared authority. In direct opposition to their fortune was the small group of government-bendings flying up the tunnel, looking very serious and very armed.'Well now lady, let’s see how you really bend ‘em over.' Gog quipped and released the illusion from Lyath.To wake up an Undershard is not a simple task. The eruption of a volcano, a massive earthquake, or the crushing impact of a celestial body may bolster a stirring or rouse a rollover; anything else is likely to go unnoticed. It was then to the begrudging surprise that the young guard of the Undershard village of Mudhallow awoke to the rumbling of its villagers in panic, the snaping and grinding of dirt and rocks as they shifted and hurried within the soil, and the moucousy, slipping sounds of the worms fleeing the community. The Undershard can be thought of as a spirit being, inhabiting the dirt, rocks, and minerals of the planet universally, and taking physical form only when needed. The villages and communities they form throughout The Beneath would appear to most as any other conglomeration of earthen material; those with accute spiritual or magical sense could detect the bustle and day-to-day activities of these beings. Today, the villagers of Mudhallow are in disarray because The Dark Forest had come.As the forest spreads its tendrils of sorrow and corruption it contaminates soil, water, vegetation, wildlife; everything caught in its path. The Undershard were no different and as the black filth of the forest began seeping into the soil of the village the inhabitants began to flee. Dregdrie could sense the pollution forming in the village, a dark, tarry ooze that was surgically creeping into any recess within the soil. The guard could sense the death of the soil, the nutrients being sapped and the minerals being isolated. The bacteria choked; silence. The worms moved; silence. The youth near the edge of the village cried; silence. The darkness was a wall of silence, a wave of death; Dregdrie felt anger and disgust such that he caused a tremor through the earth for miles. HE would stop this now.Dregbie sent tells to the villagers to move towards and behind him. As they did he harnessed his command over the earth about them crushing and pulverizing the materials into a fine sand and then compressing it with great will, forming a hardened glass-like barrier. It was a shield garnered from honor and sacrifice, yet the ways of darkness are thrfty and nimble in the face of valor. With surprising speed the pollution creeped under and over the barrier and began plunging its wicked slivers into the very essence of the Undershard, extinguishing their existence. Candlelight; those of Mudhallow where being left as cold, waxy wicks in the face of a gale without compassion or deliberation to the reaping of its consumption.Dregdrie knew he could stay and die or escape and warn the other Undershard communities of the coming horror. He called forth the worms, he called them and gave them strength and a new purpose, to help his kind. The remaining villagers took to the worms, one by one, and scattered in all directions so as not to be followed by the darkness. Dregdrie knew what needed to be done, it was told to him by his ancestors as theirs to them.“Seek the light.” He thought for a brief moment and then hurried through the soil, away from his village and away from his kind. He moved through the Magnetic Mountains and towards the village of the surface dwellers. He makes his way towards the center of the city and then begins manifesting in a physical form for the first time in two millennia. The rocks, soil, and worms about him begin to coalesce into rectangular appendages and attach to a torso formed of tightly compressed sand and concrete as he nears the surface. The stones of the pavement and walkways of Rupes Niagra above him take head to his coming and move about him as he breaches the surface, settling upon his large, earthen body like armor. His eyes glow as floating orbs of lava within the black recess of the granite pavement that forms his head. He looks around and sets his eyes upon a lone guard, petrified with fear.“You, fellow guardian, I need to speak with those of your kind who wish to destroy The Dark Forest.”The city guard looked up at the earthen figure before him, extending his shield and sword with a child’s grip, as if he were wielding the sterns of a bull that he could barely keep hold.The Undershard guard understood this human’s concern, few of his kind had ever seen the kind of his. He knelt down as the guard yelped and feigned behind his buckler.“What is your name, guard?” Dregdrie asked in a deep bass yet with the eloquence of a diplomat. Geologic time is slow and allows for patient and thorough study into the knowledge of the world. Dregdrie spoke most present day languages and many that have been lost to time.“Marcus . . . Marcus Truespear.” He shuddered.“Well Marcus, I suspect you are a bit frightened by my earthen exterior but the interior is as soft as moss on an oak tree, I assure you.” Dregdrie smiled which amounted to the pavement stones that formed what would be a mouth moving up and into a V-shape.Marcus calmed at the empathy and calm banter displayed by the creature and lowered his weapons.“Hey, there we go, we have no quarrel with each other. Now, I need to speak with your village leader or a guild leader or somebody who is in charge of battling The Dark Forest. Surely there must be a council to extinguish this scourge from our world!” His eyes burn brighter as he feels the anger well inside of him.“Well, there is a call to the adventurers of the region to join and fight it as one. It is in the papers and on the message boards in every village and city for miles. It says to go to the Lionfang Bar if interested.” The city guard explains while still gaining his composure.“Splendid, well and good, guard. Please take me there.”The two walked a couple of blocks towards the bar.“This will do, guard. Thank you for your kindness and my debt to you I will pay at your bidding.” Dregdrie nods his head in gratitude.“Please end this curse for all of our sakes.” The guard bows in return and then runs back towards his post.The earthen guard stands there turning his head and ‘smiling’ towards the curious and the terrified that move about him. However, there is one who peers out from within the bar and shows no sign of fear or confusion; calmly beaconing.The tremors through the earth were subtle as Dregdrie approached but certainly noticeable by the patrons in Lionfang Bar. A group had formed near the bar causing the hulking golem to bend to see the extent of the association. He was familiar with each sort of creature that held party to the sortee, some better than others, except for one; an unearthly composition of material that Dregdrie simply could not fathom was of the nature he knew. The dark elf; his village and he were from below, the same. The life-chewer; he knew of his kind from wormtales. The manticore; their kind garnered respect from the Undershard.Perhaps it was no coincidence then that Freila was the one to beacon for Dregdrie to join them. She had taken notice of his approach, as had Nuuzrael who instead looked out with guarded discernance. Dregdrie was much too colossal at the moment to enter the establishment without making catastropic renovations. He disanimated the larger chucks of pavement and rubble that made the bulk of his form; they fell and stacked onto the road like a scholar drops their books after a long and tedious day of research. He coalesced into a smaller, humanoid form composed mostly of sand, gravel, and a handful of worms that slowly worked their way in and out of his torso and appendages. He formed a carapace of the harder minerals and rocks available in the material he had come from, forming a mostly white and black mosaic of armor plates in the appropriate locations for a biped. His face was a smooth, ever slightly shifting motion of sand that held a nose, lips, and ears to provide for a more familiar and approachable demeanor. That was not to include his eyes that remained as excited globules of lava and flame.Still rather tall, he ducks under the entrance and approaches the bar. The banter amongst the decopage of creatures halts as he steppes near.“Thank you sister of the steppe.” Dregdrie bows to Freila who nods in return.“Creatures, I am in need of those who wish to destroy the scourge you may know as The Dark Forest. My village has been all but destroyed and scattered by its filthy claws; it must go no further.” He bellows with highlights of regret.“Silly, you don’t have to yell, we’re right here!” Ester glees and waves to a grateful smile returned by the earthen being. “We are The Dark Forest Adventuring Destroyer Company, Incorporated . . . “ She stands at attention and salutes before hearing the words she spoke “ . . . err, probably not ‘incorporated’, maybe more like, heh . . .” She blushes and sits back down.“Thank you little fae, it would have that fate may be at odds with The Dark Forest as well.” Dregdrie tries at a whisper which is lower in volume but still distinguishable down the street from the bar.“Barkeep, err, please serve a pint of your finest hazlenut ale to each of these creatures that sit before you.” He follows his request by removing a dazzling, aqua and green gem from within his earthen frame, flipping it over the group and onto the counter.Dregdrie eyed the malformation before him. The Undershard would find this creature’s abject disregard for the natural order and use of the earth’s materials with seeming depravity as an affront to the delicate balance of nature and a crime against beings whose compositions include a soul. Dregdrie was young, however, and in his hour of need not so quick to cast judgment. The creature intrigued him in fact; he spoke of the old ones, the golem was sure of that.“I am no god, I am Dregdrie, guard of Mudhallow. I may sleep much but I do not require any alignment of stars to awake.” He smirks wrly at Dagan.“A creature of many eyes, as we know them.” Dregdrie answers Akuzen as he stands near the collection of adventurers. He has no need to consume foreign materials in order to maintain his form, so much so as the soil is not soured, so he stands awaiting details of the plan.“Clever with powerful magic but I am yet to find where this one has hidden off itself. It wears a cloak of elf hide but in it where is there to hide?” Dregdrie questions before returning his attention to Chia who was apparently leading the party.“I am Dregdrie, guard of Mudhallow, I humbly command the earth and worms. I agree with the dark elf of Baddar, the creatures of this world have no time to spare in ending the blight of the Dark Forest. If there is to be action, then I shall act.”Dregdrie was taken back by the sensation of touching another being; he could not remember if he had done so the two millennia ago during his last trip to the surface and it likely didn’t matter, he was stunned. The beholders lengthy fingers extended like crystalline spider webs over the gravelley fists the golem had fashioned for himself. They felt like gnarled manzanita twigs poking soil through a waterskin canteen.The Undershard knew only superficiously of the madness a beholder could carry;the paranoia. If this beholder were mad enough to construct himself into a new creature yet still with heart to seek the end of The Dark Forest, Dregdrie had no desire to meet the malfeasance to nature that could be wrought by the truly deranged. This creature was a healer yet healed not himself; a creature with substantial knowledge concealed in a small head. Dregdrie decided he would not pulverize the wirey skin-wearer into a dusty lump of bonemeal.“I have recently found your tiny head to be quite pleasurable as well.” Dregdrie smiled a loose and genuine crease of sand across where his mouth should be and left a handful of worms in Dagan’s clasping hands. “The rest of you, however, should be nourished, these will help.” The Undershard went to slap Dagan on the back but stopped midswing, fearing he might break the beholder. He decided instead to tap him on the top of the head with a single finger.Dregdrie eyed Aku as he bit and then drained the lifeforce from the little worm.“Ha, you have good taste life-chewer!” Dregdrie exclaimed and then opened his fist to produce another handful of worms; he dropped them in front of Aku. “There are more where those came from.”Dregdrie then heard the voice, thin and nervous in tone but full of thunder in its intent. It had been a decade maybe since he heard that voice last. It was unseasonably rainy that year and the groundwater levels surrounding Mudhallow rose to such heights that they threatened his village. The Mudhallow Cornerstone took to the surface to ask the queen of storms to please stop the deluge of rain in hopes of sparing the destruction of the village. Dregdrie accompanied as the Cornerstone’s escort. They stood there, among the clouds in spirit form, and begged the queen to end the rains. She looked them up and down like they were less than the dirt from which they called home.“You dare ask me to end my life-giving, purifying rain to save, what . . . a path of filth and worms hidden somewhere in The Beneath? Below where no one cares, except the worms, of course.” Dregdrie would never forget that voice or the way she smirked as she slandered his home and his kind.“I would do better to wash your hallow of mud from this world, dirty rock-haunters!” It was there that the queen of the storm kingdom banished the Cornerstone and Dregdrie out of the clouds. They returned to find their village was gone and the sprits of the Undershard would move to an area closer to the Magnetic Mountains and better shielded from erosion should the storms come again.Dregdrie stood quickly and without a sound encased the queen in a carapace of stone. She muffled something from under the rock and Dregdrie watched her exposed eyes furl in anger. He placed the queen upon the bar and in front of Aku.“Life-chewer, this creature is the enemy of the worms and the enemy of the earth. Have your way with her and rid us of her hate.”Dregdrie heard Nuuzrael request assistance as more than willing to help; he felt it necessary to act quickly and hoped that helping this elf creature would show the Chia they were true warriors.Dredgrie dissolved into the floorboards of the tavern like sand through the waist of an hourglass. It would only take a second for him to move out of the tavern and under the streets but it would be plenty of time for the guard of Mudhallow to prepare for a fight. He heard the venerable chatter of the worms up the street from where the hunters approached and felt there vibrations in the soil; tracking their every step. He moved through soil and pavers and rocks and gravel that composed the many layers of the streets. He laid in wait for the precise moment; the sound of the earth trembling, the sifting of sand, the crack of concrete and brick caught the hunters off guard as their eyes darted to identify the cause of the raucous. Paver by paver, stone by stone, by in a what looked like dominos tumbling in reverse, Dregdrie lifted the street underneath the hunters causing them to fall and roll in sequence until they were deposited in front of Nuuzrael and Madaline. As he returned the materials to their place Dregdrie resumed his prior form, animating the pavers and stone left outside of the tavern and manifesting behind the hunters, opposite the dark elf and the pirate. He towered over the confused hunters and looked down with his burning lava eyes.“Heh, heh, heh, heh.” The undershard guard smirked and rolled out a heavy, slow laugh with bass tones that gently shook the buildings surrounding them.Dregdrie had spent the evening within the soil of the Magnetic Mountains and made his stay as the adventurers began forming partnerships to help stave away the darkness that the sinister forest is to unleash upon their group. He thought this clever and was grateful for the direction provided by Chia as it is something he himself would not have considered being that he has always been the sole Druckbrucker of his village.As the corpse-eater and one of the fairies formed their partnership, Dregdrie emerged from beneath the feet of the group as a subtle tremor and low-frequency murmur. He formed a humanoid form similar to that he had used in town; a stony carapace for protection and beaming orbs of lava for eyes. Seeing the need for light, he formed his interior of a type of glowing stone found throughout the caves of this region. It illuminates well enough to see an ample amount of paces before oneself and can be shielded away under his armor should stealth be required.“Sister of the plains,” he addressed Freila, “my kind like to say that those who are of a great partnership will have one of bedrock and one of soil. This is like one taking the high ground and the other taking the low ground. I am sure you can suspect that I have a natural inclination towards the ground and that you, with your speed and your wings, are well suited for that which is above the ground. So I ask that we create a partnership as asked of by Chia and protect our group from that which might assail us from the ground and from the air.”He opened his large, stone hand to reveal three cone-shaped gems, illuminated with a calm, undulating green light.“My kind call these Tangle Stones.” He placed one into the manticore’s hand and moved the other stones behind him. The gem in Freila’s hand dimed as Dregdrie moved the other two away.“These stones are siblings to each other and they take on a sadness when away from their brothers and sisters. Should we become apart, the stones shall tell us and when we are near, the stones shall also tell us.”Dregdrie then turned to the dark elf, Nuuzrael.“Dark elf, please carry this if it so suits you, should I or the manticore tarry too far, you can follow the light of the stone to find us again.”“So, what do you think?” Dotty questioned as she took a seat across the small dinette from Bryan. Her silver hair bounced with her motion, like the liveliness in her step, both defying her age.Bryan stared into the black of his coffee. He likes his whiskey straight, his cigars mild, his women brunette, his fiddle warm, and his coffee black. He is a straight shooter and expects the same from others, despite the absurdity of expectation in some situations. The morning sun reflected off the undulating laps in his mug; half-arched strings of light frantically clawing to escape the dark caffeinated lake.“What do I think?” Bryan stared at his coffee.“It seems pretty clear to me, Dotty.” Bryan looked up and squared his focus on Dotty’s kind eyes.He paused and without blinking planted his right elbow into the table and waged an accusatory pointer in the direction of nothing in particular.“I think David Bowie and Elton John are the same person.” Satisfied with the grandeur of his explanation, Bryan smiled wryly and leaned back into his chair, folding his hands behind his head and crossing his legs as if half-expecting Dotty to graciously thank him for bestowing upon her his epiphany.“Oh, Jesus.” Dotty rolled her eyes and smiled, her condescending facial expression leaving little to the imagination , as if Bryan had just introduced her to an imaginary friend.“Think about it! Major Tom and Rocketman; the characters and the glam; the cocaine . . .” Bryan leaned in and gave Dotty a couple of quick winks, “ . . .they were both knighted!”“Bowie refused it.” Dotty asserted.“Whatever, he probably refused it because it would give up their cover. I bet Marilyn Monroe and Princess Dianna have squared off in some kind of afterlife celebrity mud wrestling showdown to determine whose candle Sir Elton Bowie is really singing about.” Bryan shifted his eyes towards the window as Dotty exploded in a fit of raucous laughter.“I mean, I hope it’s mud wrestling.” Bryan smiled.Dotty composed herself, wiping tears from her eyes.Bryan is a straight shooter but only as much as his stage presence will allow. Bryan is a performer beyond anything else and would be remiss to pass up an opportunity for a sarcastic quip, a satirical interjection, or a conspiratorial rumination. Much of his charm lies in his open, vibrant personality. He is a social butterfly of old; he does not own a smartphone and finds contemporary social media cold and disingenuous. When Bryan asks ‘how are you doing?’, he’s asking with true concern. When Bryan says ‘it will be alright’, he honestly believes it will. When he says ‘I know how you feel’, he does so from a place of empathy.“Ash, you silly hooligan, what about Ash?” Dotty smiled and looked at him like his mother looks at him, requesting and conveying a response in the same tender glance.“I can’t go to that meeting, Dotty. Last time I was at a city council meeting I was thrown out because I threatened to murder a councilmember’s snickerdoodle if they approved a dog park next to a chromium plating business; and I like snickers, I’m not myself if I don’t eat one.”“They can use all the help they can get. I mean, the bastards are trying to pull strings behind those poor kids’ backs, the cowards.” Dotty looked off into nothing. Dotty and Paulie have had more than their fair share of encounters with the law and she likens Paulie and Bryan are similar in their disdain for those who seek to control others.“I would do more harm than good.”“Maybe equal parts harm and good would be okay for this matter?” Dotty reasonsed and Bryan smirked; she turned sage and unscrupulous trial lawyer in the same breath.Bryan thought for another moment and then astonished himself with a moment of clarity.“I think some salt-of-the-earth, homegrown, no-nonsense kind of good is all we need. Thanks Dotty.”Bryan grabbed his coat from the back of the chair, kissed Dotty on the forehead, and was out the door in hardly more than a single motion.Bryan was keenly aware of the local beat and knew where to find Chief Mallows on a Saturday morning. Bryan turned left and saw Chief Mallows’s cruiser on the other end of the street. Chief Mallows handed something to someone he can’t quite make out and then lurched the cruiser forward in Bryan’s direction. Quickly he ran towards the cruiser, arms outstretched and a look of distress ironed to his face. The cruiser jumped to a quick stop as Bryan placed his hands behind his back and slammed his torso onto the hood of the car.“Officer, arrest me, I have sinned!” Bryan yelled, followed by boisterous, fabricated sobbing sounds.“Dang nabit Breaker, how am I going to eat my breakfast when I’ve got a two-bit knee slapper ruining the wax job on my cruiser.” Chief Mallows stepped out of the cruiser and Brenda did the same from the passenger side.“I can’t go on living like this Chief.” Bryan whimpered and moaned. “Hey, Brenda.”“Morning, Yernifvick.” She flatly responded.“It’s ‘yen-off-chick’,” he replied with composure before rolling over the hood and back to his rue, “Yanofchick! Satan’s name; help me Chief, please.”The Chief grabbed Bryan by the collar of his coat with both hands and stood him up straight.“This better be good, Breaker.” A warning.“You know me Mellow, I’m always good, right Brenda?”“Fuck you Bryan.”“See.” Bryan agreed.The Chief released his grip and gave Bryan his most sincere ‘this better be real good or you’re going for a ride downtown’ cop glare.“So, there’s this meeting going on today, right? Something to do with the Smith’s bar and the townsfolk renting pitchforks and torches or something.”“I am aware.” Chief Mallows nodded.“So, the way I see it, you owe me absolutely nothing and I owe you a whole lot, thanks.” Bryan grabbed the Chief’s hand and shook it vigorously. “I have a friend, just one, and his name is Ash and he happens to be one of the Smith kids who owns that bar. Now, I also see that you owe nothing to the Smith kids either, as far as I know.’“What in the blue blazes . . .” the Chief removed his hat in astonishment at the words spewing from Bryan’s mouth.“Wait, hear me out.” Bryan pressed his finger to the Chief’s lips no quicker than it was batted away.“Ash has seen some cloudy days as of late and now his brothers and sisters are trying to convene for a reunion or something. So, I was thinking, since you are in a position of owing nothing to us, why don’t you let the council know that it is in the best interest of the town and America and all that is God-fearing and holy to list Smith’s Hearth as a state and national historic location and to fight ‘til the death to keep the heart and purpose of this city in tack as we move forward to a better tomorrow here in Providence 2.0.” Bryan ended his pitch by clicking his heels and saluting the Chief with one hand over his heart.Chief Mallows was not completely flummoxed by Bryan’s request as they had built an understanding between each other over the years and doing so gave special insight into the theatrics involved in such an endeavor. It did give him pause, however, for a moment. ‘The heart and purpose . . .’ he rolled Bryan’s words through his mind.“Get out of here before I let Brenda do what she’s thinking about doing.” He shoed the excitable fiddler up the road. Brenda smiled at the prospect and dipped into the car.“Hey, I’ll see what I can do.” Chief Mallows shouted as he too ducked back into the cruiser. Bryan turned around, smiled, and bowed towards the Chief.“Namaste.” Bryan whispered.Chief Mallows listened patiently as is his way in all things, while sitting in the front row of the town council chambers, where seats are reserved for town staff. Next to him, though not exactly staff but more like the staff mascot was his only daughter, Nancy Mallows.Whereas Chief Mallows could have walked a cliché from any story about small town cops, it would be hard to conjure an image of Nancy from any yet told story without doing her a radical injustice. Her auburn hair, naturally curled, danced in coordinated ringlets of aptitude and grace when she moved. Her skin was like warm, unblemished beach sand to match her equally warm character. Her sharp features are reminiscent of both a calculating librarian and a film-noir damsel with a body cast from the stanzas of wanting poets and the swoon-inducing lyrics of songwriters collected over centuries of pining and desire. She grew up in the town hall, mostly, and The Smith’s Hearth, secondarily. The town staff that remained mostly the same over the years saw her grow from a witty, playful little girl into the smart, selfless, and positive woman she was at the town meeting. Her father, the ever present arm of the law, would have her complete her studies and other activities at the pub when he had to work later than usual, like many other kids over the years. Her mother left home six months after she was born and joined a cult. One year later she was found dead with 11 others in a cabin deep in the forest where each had doused themselves in gasoline and lit themselves on fire. Chief Mallows was a rookie cop then and was thankful for the offers of help and support by the townsfolk and graciously accepted them. It is no wonder that Nancy would go on to study urban planning at university and then land use and environmental law before passing the state BAR. She owns a successful consulting firm in the city but regularly visits Providence. The town meeting was as much a visit as it was a defensive maneuver on her part.“Dad, you have to say something, you cannot let this end with Pastor ‘Prim-dick’ calling the shots.” Nancy tilted to her left and whispered to her father, her clenched, white knuckles in stark contrast to the black of her notepad and the maroon of her skirt and jacket.“I know I know, Muffin, but I can’t very well interrupt the man now can I, that would be mighty impolite.” Chief Mallows whispered back without taking his eyes off Pastor Prim as he addressed the council from the podium.“He is no man, he is a demon-creature sent straight from hell.” Nancy’s voice rises in volume to match her vehement disdain for the pastor, garnering a ‘Shhh!’ from an older lady behind her.“He might very well be just that but even demon-creatures get their say when at the podium.” He concluded with a short nod.“You know Muffin, I hadn’t thought much to come down here and pipe up about this but Breaker talked to me this morning and he said something that . . . well, here I am. He said that the Hearth was part of the ‘heart and purpose’ of this town and I got to thinking, I think he is damn right.” The Chief leaned in to Nancy, readying himself to take to the podium and give his thoughts on the matter.Breaker. Bryan. Nancy remembered him from some years ago. She was amazed by his performance in a local art installation, so much so she came back the next night to see him again. She remembered feeling like he was explaining to her what was going through his mind as he shifted and grinded and dipped and bowed, as if he was whispering commentary into her while she watched. He invoked two Bryan’s with his performance, both were for her, she remembered. She never got to meet him and the years folded onto the next and with them, those moments silenced in the creases.“Tell them.” She commands and waves towards the dais.Chief Mallows moved to his own rhythm that was in perfect syncopation with the rest of Providence. He hitched his cop belt and removed his sunglasses, exposing his delicate and caring eyes to an unsuspecting audience. He stepped to the podium and the room fell silent.“Mister Mayor and honorable town council members. I have worked as an officer in Providence for over 30 years and I have seen this town change soon enough as you might change your underwear.” The audience chuckled but he would not be deterred.“I can tell you one thing, well actually I could tell you many things but one of them is that there is no need to wait this out and investigate or any nonsense such as that. I will tell you that The Smith’s Hearth is not just a bar or a pub or whatever whoever wants to call it, it is a home. It is a home to the Smith children, it was a home to my daughter Nancy, hell Mayor it was a home to your boy for a spell there. It’s been a home to many for many years. Imagine if I came to your house and told you that it didn’t fit the ‘character’ of your neighborhood anymore and that you had to get out so we could replace it with condominiums, huh? That wouldn’t feel so good I imagine and that is exactly what you are going to do to this town if you take action against the Smith’s bar. Thank you.” He concluded and turned from the podium, replacing his glasses to their rightful place.“It is the heart and purpose of this town.” Nancy stands and yells at the council members.“That’s damn right.” Jo Rani stands and yells in support.One by one the supporters and extended ‘family’ of the Smith’s Hearth began standing and clapping and cheering. Pastor Prim looked around with a vague veil of disgust.Bryan Yanofchick; Nancy remembered his full name.“Ashes my dear boy, the real question is . . . are the ladies ready for this?” He popped his head out of the tiny RV bathroom with a beaming artificial smile. Ash felt there was nothing noticeably different regarding his appearance when compared to yesterday or the day before or before that and so on.“You put on your work clothes?” Ash questioned with a shy bent of sarcasm.“I am always working Mr. Smith, therefore it is I that the clothes do put on!” He asserted irrationally and with pride.“Thank you much dear, be good.” He kissed Dotty on the forehead as she tuned in the radio at the front of the Breaker-christened ‘mobile castle’ to the local station that would be broadcasting the night’s performances. Bryan was outfitted in a worn pair of denim jeans, a white Bauhaus turtle neck beneath a black, pinstriped vest, and his everyday navy trench coat. Sandals; he was also sporting a brightly-colored set of flip-flops with pink palm trees and yellow beach towels.Breaker and Ash left Dotty’s with a heading straight through the brush, past the bridge, past the industrial block, and onto Main Street.“Break a leg!” Dotty shouted from outside the caravan and waved cheerfully.Bryan stopped cold and turned around, “How dare you wicked witch woman.”Ash chuckles and the two walk smiling towards the pub.Bryan did not grow up in Providence like so many of the middle to older-aged townsfolk had. He was not privy to the Smith’s hospitality until a handful of years ago when he first played the pub as part of a combo group playing venues up and down the highway. When disagreement arose and Bryan ardent in standing his ground, he and the ground stood and watched as his bandmates drove off in their janky tour van. He was fine with it and a bit relieved; weeks cooped up in a van with anyone is enough to give him pause.His regular gigs were not at the Smith’s; the Smith’s was his escape and he liked to leave work at the office, as it were. The Smith’s was his crackling fire during the endless winters and his lazy river in oppressive humidity of summer. He snapped a catalogue of postcard memories over the years exalting the view of Main Street from the pub to mythical proportions. The lull of dusk as it marshalled the evening through the autumn-colored street trees with banners of pink, purple, and blue, beaconing the tranquil amber of the street lights struck at his romanticism like the shattering sulfur of a match strike. The fall undoubtedly would lead to thinking of her.Prior to making Providence his extended stay town of choice as he made his way about the region, soaking up the locals and the music scene, he performed in an edgy, avant-garde performance installation about a block away from the Smith’s. The piece was simply called ‘Circles’ and it was designed to channel music and dance between eleven performers in a more or less seamless, three-dimensional auditory and visual relay. The piece grew in complexity, volume, and passion as the performance cycled through the room. Bryan loved it and surprised even himself at moments when his heart and fiddle were vying for command over his soul and being. It was during one of these climactic battles that Bryan saw an unspeakably beautiful girl in the audience. He remembers thinking if Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor were genetically fused together and cast in a Winona Ryder mold, that girl would be the result. She was the shadow of moonlight on marble, the reflection of tulips on playful drops of spring rain, the breath of laughter between lover’s over the crisp of fresh morning snow.Twice she would enter his rambling, chaotic circus act of an existence like the calm of dusk over the ocean and twice he would bury himself in the sand of a school boy’s nervous and anxious fear.“Hey Breaker, you there man?” Ash raised a voice of concern and a waving hand to try and reel in Bryan from his longing.“ You ever see an angel, Ash?” Bryan responded while clawing his way out of his pit of regret.“Sure, my Mom and Eloise, they’re just about as close as you can get.”“False, angels are not real, so maybe she was just a hallucination?”“Oh oh, not this again,” Ash rolled his body in a fit as if he was losing consciousness, “praise the angels we’re here.”The two exchanged a surprised and bewildered glance before turning back to see the mob of people clamoring outside the pub.Breaker had dropped off his fiddle and coat in the backroom. He walked out of the room and was thoroughly delighted by the chaotic sopranos of dinnerware and plates, the robust altos and baritones born of dozens of conversations, the swoosh of the toilets, and the motion of doors and cupboards, all riding on the fat bass of footsteps, elbows and tables, and half-back glances and other-looks between the singles and the singles-for-tonight.It had been some time since the pub was churning with such energy. The patrons were buzzing and the air was thick with energy like the crisp ozone left after the sparking arc of a Tesla coil. Bryan was home and the bar became more homely as the crowd grew thicker and the liquor drew thinner.Bryan spotted Ash and heard his introduction of Hayden just as he was approaching the two as they stood near the end of the bar, just out of the travel lane between the dining area and the restrooms.“A fine evening and as such it becomes more so by our meeting, Mr. Hayden.” Bryan bowed and then curtseyed.“Um, hey?” Hayden was mildly irritated at being dumfounded by what had just happened.Bryan snuck in close and put his arm around Hayden.“Tell me Hayden, did anyone ever think your name was actually Den because they thought someone was just calling for you, like “Hey . . . Den, how’s it going?”“I don’t . . . “ Hayden thought about it but had no time to respond.“I never get that.” Bryan’s face deconstructed into a forced aberration most likely meant to resemble sorrow.“Not once has anyone, ever in their life, thought my name was Ann. “ Bryan’s smile quickly returned and he gave Hayden a chummy slap on the back. “Lucky you, Denny!”“Right . . . thanks, yeah.” Hayden shot a stare towards Ash that could have cut a diamond. Ash quickly looked to his shoes for answers.“I would love to discuss some other naming misconceptions but as you can see, my people await.” Bryan stepped back and extended his arms out in full embrace of the atmosphere.“Adieu, Mr. Den and Mr. Ly.” The fiddler exclaimed and then motioned for himself to make his way into the dining area.Hayden looked towards Bryan and then back at Ash with a furled brow. Ash responded with a half-smile that read as ‘sorry?’; in his heart he hid a genuine smile and a ‘that never gets old.’Bryan crossed the stretch of bar near the dining area and out towards the small dance floor and the nearby stage. He breathed in the atmosphere with a growing smile as if it were nitrous oxide. The stage was near the entrance and he could see the line of anxious patrons through the Dutch-style, double-paned windows with Tommy at the entrance looking wildly out-of-place as any sort of bouncer and Ford running defense on the line just off the sidewalk. The classic 80’s one-hit wonder “In a Big Country” dances a lively, triumphant jig from the pub’s sound system.When Bryan’s generation was young, interesting people were often referred to as unique or special, now in his 30’s Bryan would likely be pegged as autistic or having attention-deficit disorder; whatever the diagnosis, Bryan’s hearing was and had always been astounding. He could keep track of half a dozen conversations in a crowded bar, tell you what note the tea kettle was whistling, and what the caller on the phone just ordered to go without breaking a sweat. The two young men discussing their plan at the corner of the bar would never have suspected that someone with such acute listening capabilities would be there to pick up on their conversation.“So, Mother tells me Jenny is gonna be at the grill tonight celebrating some church-girl’s birthday and I thinking you know, time to make my move there, right?” Henry, the slightly older, red-haired and freckled young man explained in a whisper to the other. He is the oldest son of Susan Flannigan, proprietor of Sue’s Bar and Grill and a long-time competitor of the Smith’s. Sue and Robert Smith had become infamous over the years due to the slander and fighting that would erupt wherever the two met.“Now all I hear is everyone heading down to the Smith’s and Mother’s grill is empty as a lobster pot in a kiddy pool.” Henry peers around at the Smith’s establishment.“This won’t due, how am I supposed to make her like me with all these folks about? So I have an idea, see? It’s simple, we’re gonna go in the bathrooms, shove some toilet paper and paper towels in the johns and then flush them all. You can’t have much of a bar without bathrooms, right?” He slings out a backhand across the clavicle of Todd, the slightly younger, brown-haired and fair-skinned accomplice.“I don’t know Henry, it’s got to be illegal or something . . .” Todd squirmed and stuttered.“Hey, if I’m gonna get into littleJenny’s good book then we need a quiet place to discuss the details, right?” He gave Todd the from-under-the-lids stare customary of any seasoned, peer-pressuring bully.“And I’ll tell you, I am looking to binge read that shit, ha!” He backhands Todd again and leans back into the stool and the waiting left arm of Breaker who swooped in and put one arm around each of the young men.“Come now,” Bryan tutors, “any grown ass man knows that the way under the Sunday’s best of a daughter of the lord is not by command, but through poetry, numskull.”“Excuse me.” Henry motioned a half-hearted attempt at pushing Bryan off his shoulder, the fiddler responded by tightening his choke holds and bringing the boys in closer.“Seeing as you might need to brush up a bit on your Tennyson there sport, I suggest you two head home and jump on your Facechat and send out a sobbing, pathetic plea for help on picking up the ladies, might save you some jail time and a lot of self-fulfilling prophecy if you catch my drift.”“You son of a . . .” Henry made an enraged, full-hearted attempt at shouldering Bryan away and then threw a right hook as Bryan backed away. The swing missed and Henry followed with a left that Bryan juked, backing further towards the dance floor.“I mean, I know this hot librarian who . . .”Bryan goaded the seething young man while Henry furiously plummeted another right from above his head. Bryan spun, and grabbed Henry’s left hand, bended it behind his back and broke his pinky in one fluid motion. The cracking sound of the disjointment of the young man’s finger could have silenced thunder.“Mother fucker!” Henry’s voice cracked like he was back in middle school and grimaced at the pain.The bar took notice and the chatter and motion stopped as Bryan quickly moved Henry out the entrance with Todd close behind. At the edge of the sidewalk he gave Henry a solid flip-flop to the coccyx and Henry shyly met the sidewalk.“Hey Ford, this young man was just heading home to brush up on his manners and his bible studies.” Bryan shouted as Ford approached from near the back of the line.Bryan scanned the area and upon meeting the eyes of Pastor Prim, smiled and blew him a kiss. Bryan thought it strange for a man of the cloth to be awake after 5PM, didn’t he have an alter or something he had to retreat to when night fell?“Praise Jesus, what a miracle, this boy is saved!” Bryan shouted in his best accent of an old church lady and spun towards the bar. He stopped Todd and with dead sincerity told him to find new friends, before blasting knuckles with Ford and reentering the bar.The patrons looked on and Bryan responded, “I know, right? Who titles a song with the same name as their band?”Bryan heard the muffled toll of the German coocoo clock that hung above the bar. The traditional clamor of the mechanical fowl had long ago be silenced but the ding of the bell carried on. His pedal board and wireless mic were already setup on stage and in customary fashion he would meet up with the house band after he was introduced.After about 30 seconds and no clapping or hooting from the crowd to usher him in, he left the backroom and headed for the stage. As he approached, fiddle and bow in hand, the crowd began to take notice and the regulars started a hesitant and uncoordinated round of applause to welcome the first performer. As suspected, the house band was ready to jam. Mike Tilly set behind his minimalist kit; a snare, kick drum, hi-hat, and a 4-inch splash. Mike was built like a line-backer, all 90-degree angles and all muscle but with a smile that could melt your nana to bake him cookies. Jay Strauss stood to Mike’s left with his upright bass and held it as if he were about to dance with a goddess. Jay was a gangly six-and-a-half-foot-Abbott to Mike’s Costello. Squaring off the trio was Aldous “Al” Baker, with his Vox Continental glistening in red, white, and black like he stole it from a White Stipes album cover. Al’s father was a novelist and became a spirited dystopian after the dreams of the late 60s slowly dissolved to the glamour of disco. He had seen The Doors perform many times in those days, being an aspiring poet as so many were, and left it to his son to carry out his musical ambitions that never found their footing because he had not a modicum of musicality within him. Thus, Al’s father became a novelist and bestowed upon his son the iconic electric organ that he would command in ways that Manzarek would have found astonishing.Mike, Jay, and Al grew up in Providence and learned much about stage presence, practice, and getting along with bandmates at a young age in the very bar they were about to perform. While other kids were completing their homework or hatching schemes to pilfer another cookie from plate on the counter that never seemed to dwindle, the trio would be found in the backroom; practicing, recording, mapping out their path to fame. Not being much into the ways of book learning or for adventure, their dreams of small-town-come-big-time settled into big-in-a-small-town-is-alright, as they could be seen in most establishments throughout the county at sometime during the week, playing whatever paid for whoever would listen. It was enough to keep them housed and fed, a joint in the case, dancing with the ladies, and an occasional peyote-infused, shamanic -getaway to ‘get back to what really matters’.Bryan took the stage, shaking the hands of each of the bandmates that were also some of his closer friends. He turned and faced the audience, the spotlight on him and the house lights dimmed to give the stage its full attention. Bryan addressed the crowd as he went about his preparations.“Thank you and welcome to all you beautiful, lucky folk out there tonight.” The crowd agreed and responded with a brief wave of hoots and hollers.“My grandfather used to say that the voice, the voice is the instrument of God. It is a precious thing, it must be cherished and treated with respect. The fiddle, he would say, now that’s the devil’s instrument and well, you can do whatever the hell you want with it.” Bryan smiled and the crowd leapt into a fit of laughter, clapping, and fist pumps.“So I am obliged to do whatever the hell I want, not being one to break with tradition.” Jay began plucking the upright on cue with a droning three-note pattern, down then up the polished rosewood. Mike followed shortly with a subtle 1-3 on the closed hi-hat and a shuffling ostinato on the snare with the brushes.Bryan closed his eyes and from the perspective of the audience, another person might as well have had taken the stage. The wry, smiling jokester disappeared to a demeanor that was all business and possession. He lifted his bow and sawed a descending glissando of chromatic notes that chewed into the air and the sensibilities of any with a sensitive ear. He followed the riff as if it was dragging him down, ending with a pedal click that killed the lights on the stage and dancefloor of the bar. Silence for a heart beat and then another pedal click to bring the spotlight back on as Bryan slowly moved to an upright position with a lyrical, unaccompanied intro to “All Along the Watchtower”. The sound resonating from this instrument was moody and daunting, phrased into an uninterrupted sigh. If the listener knew the lyrics, they could hear each word in every note that sang from his string and bow.The band erupted to life at the start of the third verse with a chaotic, random pulsing of lights from the small LED setup above the stage. The recessed lighting under the stage was red throughout. The unspoken lyrics continued to fill the air:No reason to get excitedThe thief, he kindly spokeThere are many hear among usWho feel that life is but a jokeBryan moved with conviction and strength, as if he were giving his all to saw through his fiddle. Sweat was exploding from his dirty blond hair. He wasn’t just moving ; however, he was dancing. His feet enjoyed the knowledge of many forms of dance and with seeming randomness would shuffle between them, sometimes within a measure. His legs would bend in ways that surely would break those of a less limber person. In fact, his flexibility and coordination have failed him at times, ‘causing him to occasionally break a toe and once an ankle. As such, the moniker ‘Breaker’ has followed him through much of his career.The hour is getting lateThe band breaks for solos. First, Jay laid down an absolute combustion of notes and phrasing as he pulled out the horsehair and started bowing the upright. Nary a void of sound could be heard through his onslaught of 16th and 32nd note runs, like a spirited East Coast bebop quartet was playing from the top of the watchtower. Mike followed with a volatile whirlwind of sticks , pedals, and cymbal reflections as his solo consisted of slowing the beat, breaking out into a simple march, and then building the time and complexity of his improvisation until the speed of the song was achieved, his arms disappeared, and every surface of his drum kit seemed to have been being struck in unison.Breaker laid low while the drummer and bassist commanded the stage (Al sits this song out in respect of his father who couldn’t stand the way Jimi Hendrix played guitar), caught his breath, and surveyed the crowed from behind Al and the keys. He could feel the excitement in the crowd and he embraced it as a lifeforce. He sauntered onto the stage at the end of Mike’s solo, smoothly and gracefully, bowing a single note. He began to syncopate that note into an increasingly complex set of jazzy funk rhythms. Then, the crowd favorite; he hit the pedal board twice, causing an overdriven phased distortion on the fiddle’s mic input that bit from the house sound system as a sort of wobbly white noise with a faint Lo-Fi crackle in the background. The crowd ate it up and Bryan furiously moved from the stage to the floor, the band joined back in and with full force were driving the tune to its closure like a jazz-metal A-train blistering towards the end of the tracks and a cliff that led straight to Hades.Bryan moved through the audience like he was plowing snow with a chainsaw and the crowd obliged to make him a path. He make a quick U-turn in front of the bar; the band fell silent as did the crowd:And the wind began to howlThe unspoken lyrics echoed from his aberration of a fiddle; more so, the notes haunted from his instrument as forgotten fears left by ghosts too frightened to use them. Breaker ended the song to a stunned and enamored audience. He looked up to raise his arms and instrument to bow but was stopped cold by a different kind of ghost; it did not haunt with fear but with longing.“It’s you.” Bryan choked like a 13-year-old-boy and the crowd was witness to something few had ever glimpsed; Bryan was shocked and speechless.Nancy Mallows stared back at the man she never knew for those few moments years ago.Not unlike the inside, the back patio of The Smith’s Hearth was quaint and inviting. It was actually a deck, elevated slightly to allow for snowmelt and rain to flow underneath and to account for a small, rocky outcropping that juts into the narrow lot. The patio was outfitted with a lattice cover and with a complement of six tables and chairs of various origins in a cozy arrangement that was perfect for sitting and dropping in on other people’s business, if so desired. The real gem of the patio was the lighting. An undulating rope of chain crossed over the patio between four hand carved totem poles depicting various cultural traditions from throughout the world. On the chain hung a variety of lanterns, outfitted to accept modern-day lightbulbs but otherwise untouched from the state in which they were found. A couple were rusted completely to make identifying their composition a task suitable for only the most daring of archaeologists. The remainder were in various states of aging, some with brilliant patinas of turquoise, saffron, and verdigris. The collection represented a variety of historical and cultural events; Appalachian coal mining, the gold rush of the western United States, the lantern festivals of China, Japanese Toro Nagashi, Mexican hanging tin lanterns, clay lanterns of India’s Diwali. They provided an endearing charm, a subtle glow, and echoed that at The Smith’s Hearth, “all are welcome.”Despite the size of the crowd, the patio was empty except for three, an older man sitting near the bar exit who was genuinely proud to be video chatting with his grandkids via smartphone, and Bryan and Nancy, who sat furthest from the door and nearest to the small iron gate that led up the rocky hillside.Nancy was wearing a green turtle neck under an ancient, gray Digital Underground t-shirt that she had somehow kept in immaculate condition. This was paired with a black pleated skirt and completed with a pair of black, Balenciaga shearling slippers. She could have been wearing a garbage bag and Kleenex boxes for shoes and Bryan still would have found her intoxicating to behold.“So you see? There’s also ‘Blue Jean’ and ‘I Guess That’s Why They Call it the Blues’. I don’t think it’s a coincidence, Counsel.” Bryan exclaimed in words and through his hands, like a magician trying to conjure belief from a hat of absurdity. Nancy bowed backwards in a jubilee of laughter and smiles, tilting back in her chair and then forward with a thud of iron on wood.“That is utterly ridiculous.” She retorted with a hint of tears in her eyes. “Why would this, Bowie John, have two identities in the first place? Money? Was worldwide fame for one just not enough?” Nancy failed to act seriously.“I am glad you asked. You see, Bowie John had a thing for Princess Diana but you can’t be a knight and go around cavorting with a princess, right?”“Oh my god, you got to . . . but wait . . . Diana died in ‘97.” Nancy shot an inquisitive lawyer eye at the opposing fiddler.“Are you sure about that?” Bryan shot the same eye back at her and let his wry smile stretch in a I-have-more-where-that-came-from taunt.“Shut up!” She let the case rest, her closing arguments consisting of a shaking head, a slight shove to Bryan’s shoulder, and an are-you-for-real stare.Bryan was again speaking to Nancy as two people as he had at the art installation. Meeting at the end of Bryan’s emotionally charged performance with the dim house lights subtly hiding Nancy amongst the crowd and the eerie red glow illuminating Bryan from behind was serendipitous and would generally be sufficient in wooing all but the most hardened and discerning of potential lovers. Bryan is not one to stop at certainty. In the moments that had passed since he exited the stage, he was full of grand gestures and wild ruminations that caught Nancy by surprise and that she found thoroughly charming.Her day-to-day dealings with potential love interests included lackadaisical government officials, anxious land developers, and conniving attorneys; not exactly the ideal pool from which Nancy hoped to find someone. They were great on paper, Nancy had thought on many occasions; they had stable careers, advanced degrees, 401K, mortgage on a condo or house, the works. They also all had the same thing in common that exhausted Nancy; predictability. She could see it coming from the moment they walked into the meeting, or met at her office to discuss a project, or mingled after a city council hearing. He would see her and immediately approach, shake hands and how do’s, look her over and then again, and then proceed to try and make eye contact. After, there would be the obligatory ‘how about we get something to eat’ or ‘let me buy you a drink’ and if she were so inclined, oblige. Later, the usual banter about work and peacocking about major contracts, significant development projects, and lamenting over the inadequacy of government workers or the greed of developers. Finally, when he had drunk up enough courage he’d ask her back to his place. Generally, she’d decline but if she was feeling particularly fetching that day or feeling particularly ‘fuck it, whatever’ that day, she would oblige. She’d be gone before he woke and then they’d meet again at another something like nothing happened. None of the awkwardness or emotions others might garner, after all these were professional adults, and professional adults fuck like professional adults. Nancy thought at times how the game might bore her to a nunnery.She appreciated the confidence displayed by those looking to spend the night with her as she was not insensitive to her beauty and that it was difficult for most to approach her; but, there was confidence and then there was what Bryan exuded in torrents: sincerity. While the confident professional adult would come on full of himself and ready to execute the correct moves to find out if Nancy was wearing matching bra and panties; Bryan was full of confidence and had no idea what moves to make. Nancy thought his actions, his movement, was like watching a meteor shower. Each light fell from the sky, random and uncoordinated, and each was brilliant. His words were not calculated or rehearsed or memorized from some doctor’s office copy of Men’s Health, they were his, raw and uncompromising. He spoke out loud like the world was listening and whispered quietly to Nancy that he had no idea what he was doing, he liked her, and this is how he showed it. He smiled and gaffed and expressed across the table under the lights of the world and at the same time sat next to her, silent, looking up at a night sky that held only one light for the two of them.“I am impressed that you made it through two rounds of that installation piece, not many people subject themselves to hell more than once.” Bryan offered a pun as he stood up and walked under the lanterns as if he were an appraiser. Bryan wasn’t an anxious person nor did he tend to sweat the little things; the life of an urban gypsy taught priorities in its introductory course. Food, water, shelter, and fiddle. Generally, clothes as well but Bryan had ended up naked in a river or a fountain on occasion, but that was because other priorities took precedence. The ‘hell’ he was referring to was the deeper subject of the Circles art installation, referencing the nine circles of hell. His stop on the tour was heresy and he reveled in it. He was hired by the artist to portray a writhing, wretched heretic cast beyond the River Styx to burn forever for denying Christ. He was thrilled by the prospect, so much that he read Dante’s Inferno and other related texts in a month-long, daily pilgrimage to the library for heretical research. The installation was successful and was later released as part of a documentary on the boldest fringes in contemporary art.“I am impressed that you made it out of that hell. You looked like you were in agony, burning lake of fire and all.” Nancy stood and crumbled her limbs and twisted her neck to what might look like a zombie attempting to play violin.“You were recording me, right? Video recording was not allowed at that event, miss.” Bryan stood a bit taller. “That is the only way you could reenact my performance with such remarkable accuracy; hours and hours of study.”I have held the hand of a devilIt was warm in the nightBryan noticed that Tommy was spilling his soul into the pub like a warm blanket of glass; covered in melodic comfort, frightened that any movement would shatter it. Nancy had noticed that Bryan had noticed, he turned and his eyes saw a girl staring at him as if he were a ghost or a king or a lunar eclipse; something, Bryan knew not what. He had never had anyone look at him with that kind of enamor or understanding. Her eyes told him ‘you could stand there and ramble on about anything for the next 6 hours and I won’t budge’. His second self whispered to her ‘thanks, because I want to ramble about anything to you so you’ll stay with me.”Bryan’s second self mentioned nothing of kissing him, not that either of them had heard, yet the inertia of chemistry leads with the momentum of embrace and few forces can halt it. Nancy followed her eyes to his in a fluid step and arch that the unknowing would have thought was choreographed. Slippers met flip-flops under the warm lights of antiquity. Her lips met his and it was like neither had kissed before; neither thought anything of it. The moment was of such inexplicable perfection that neither could or wanted to think; they simply wanted to be there as they were. She stepped back and they smiled in agreement.. . . what I’m looking forThere were beings about, according to some instinctive defense system that tallied other creatures, Bryan was sure of it. Ghosts, perhaps? A competitive leg-breaking activity involving a swinging horse was apparently afoot. Fine and dandy thought Breaker’s singularly focused mind. An incomparable force from within prevented him from looking away from Nancy, terrified that she might disappear or suddenly die if he did. That was until a singularly comparable force exerted its inertia.“Breaker!” It was the voice of Zeus or Odin or General Patton, strong and echoing with authority. Bryan did not have a chance to locate the source of the celestial voice before another angelic voice intruded.“Dad?” Nancy looked over at Chief Mallows who was standing at the backdoor to the bar, the densely furled lines of his forehead and the squint in his eyes could not be interpreted as anything but seriously ticked off.“Evening Muffin.” He passed a curt acknowledgement before cutting his focus back to Bryan; the fiddler was rapidly and disorientedly forced back into reality.“ Muffin?” Bryan took a step back from Nancy, “Oh wait, eh, hey look Chief it’s not what you think, she just had some questions about Bowie and being the foremost expert I was obliged to help her out.” Bryan’s words fell from his mouth like disfigured marbles, each one expelling in a random trajectory from the last. Nancy’s mouth quickly fell agape and she stepped next to Bryan and locked her arm with his.“Dammit son,” and just like that the Chief threw his hat at the ground with all the sincerity he could muster, adding another egregiously cliche gesture to his ever evolving stereotype of a small town cop, “what exact kind of short-sighted idiot are you? You know just as well as any grade-schooler that you can’t go around breaking peoples fingers and tossing them out of public places.”“ Daddy, I am sure Bryan had a perfectly reasonable . . . “ Nancy began with some opening remarks.“Can it Nancy, this the last thing I want to have to deal with tonight.” Chief Mallows unbuttoned a pouch from his belt and brandished a set of handcuffs while retrieving his hat from the wooden deck of the patio.“Oh Mellow, come on, I’m pretty sure that kid's finger was broken before I even met him . . . ““I’ll remind you Breaker that anything you say can and will be used against you and that includes lying to an officer of the law, got it.” The Chief approached Bryan decisively, making his way around the two who were still locked arm-in-arm.“Is this really necessary, I mean . . . “ Nancy rolled her eyes as her father passed her side.“This is assault, Nancy.” Chief Mallows cut her short in a frustrated, matter-of-fact rebuttal.Nancy relieved Bryan’s arm from her choke-hold and Bryan obliged the inevitable by moving his hands into position.“Muffin, I will write. If I end up on death row, remember we’ll always have Bowie John.” Bryan whimpered while pouring absurdity into every syllable.Nancy erupted in an uncontrolled fit of laughter.“But what about the farm and little Timmy is sick with the rabies?” Nancy tried to match Bryan’s theatrics but could not keep from smiling.“Just sell it. The boy too; sell it all.” Bryan snuck in a grin as Chief Mallows started escorting Bryan towards the bar.“This isn’t over Breaker,” Nancy followed behind her father, “I am waking up next to you tomorrow morning even if it's in a holding cell.”Chief Mallow glanced back as Nancy grinned goadingly, the back door severing the night from two would-be lovers who had nearly taken it for themselves.Where are you going boy?It’s late and the cold is stillNot into the dark woodOr over cemetery hillYou can’t follow her she’s the deadDon’t let her hollow frame get inside your headStay beside the fire, stay by the lightThat is if you still value your lifeNight or Nothing, is what she saidNight or Nothing, you are good as deadShe told you night or nothing She told you sweetTake that crooked pathAnd find empty eternityYou step through stone and fogShe smiles and take her clothes offMoonlight shines her black hair shimmersInside the crypt she makes you take herIs that girl really worth it all?Giving your soul so that she can haunt itNight or Nothing , she moans for youNight or Nothing, her promise is trueI’m just gravedigger a hunchedbackOne eyed hook handed creatinWith just one design to seeBehind those cursed blackout curtainsThe kids find it odd Potions in the cauldronWell I’m the guy to testWhatever tonic is cookingOn a broom, in my arms, The haunted forest, then back to the graveyard So we can get the real party startedBlessed voodoo, am I charmed?Talking backwards, take me onAnd whisper in my ear it’s betterIf we just both speak in tonguesLet me say it like thisAbracadabra gotta have her no matter whatever kinda Potion she brewing i’m dummy to test for conclusionsProbable infusion suddenly she knew it cranked the dial a bit higher on the fire escape staircase we embrace irradiation Disintegration cerebral functions terminate into a plasmatic stateWhile others look bothered by it allI didn’t even write this songCouldn’t find the verse She wrote it for herTook away my words when she stopped and turnedLooking like audry hepburn in doc martens Her skin was glistening even in the dim moonlightNo I’m not frightened, that girl can conjure lightningNot bidding our time, instep with the rhyme, in midnights chiming, her and I are just fineDead tired but it’s only midnightFall asleep in my coffiniIt’s alright if you just move your body in real tightThere’s room for one, that's you and meWe’ll skip the morning and keep the insideWith just barely enough air to breathIn the living room of this house is a desk and a wooden chair. The patchwork rug that the furniture is set upon is old but in remarkable condition. Beneath that the flooring is brushed hardwood which has seen better days. The wallpaper depicts white tulips biting a man in half. There is no blood; possibly the tulip is just sucking on the top-half of the man and not actually biting him. There is also a sofa and what appears to be a door to a cellar. There is no television or computer in this room. There is an oversize checkers board made from two sheets of plywood, unevenly cut, with the red and black spaces created through a hasty application of spray paint. The pieces appear to be in a position where the last game was cut short. Three pieces remain on the board; two red at b1 and e4 and one black at c7. You can leave this room to the main hall, the dayroom, or the parlor.The dayroom is a quiet, brightly lit room; at, least it would be brightly lit if it was not night. Being night, you can see nothing beyond the wrap around porch outside the large windows. It is a stagnant darkness. The daybed is cream-colored with embroidered sunflowers and wooden arms. On the wall to the left of the entry is a large oil painting. It depicts a rather ugly red-headed girl in a black dress holding a dollhouse in the Victoria-style. The dollhouse is holding a doll that looks remarkably like the girl holding it. This continues and at each step the doll and the house deteriorate until there is a skeleton holding a small pile of wooden sticks. The floors here are also brushed concrete.You can move into the living room from here.The primary entry into the home leads into the main hall. It is a stately, imposing room with a double staircase that meets in the center of the room. It has an open ceiling so the landings and walkways to the

Lifting my spiritsYou’re effervescentIn need of seeing ‘though my eyes betray meFeel a subtle touching like a delicate breezeTalk to you in the darkThere’s an outline in the saltCheck the six sense and it’s pointing trueAn apparition entangled with a living boy whoTalks to you in the darkForgetting lifetimes apartMy last breath is spentYou're effervescent        The creature landed as a tangle of black, tarry tendrils on a rocky outcropping near a sparse woodland area. The same tarry substance oozed from the creature's tendrils, forming a hard shell across the rocks that would give it hold. The atmosphere is thin and the weather of this place churns and wrestles below in fits of storm and haze. Attached to the tendrils is a single eye with a saffron-colored cornea and seven etching pupils clawing inwards towards the center. Its massive eyelid blinks, sloughing off a thick coating of white mucous that served as the eye’s protection during the brief but tumultuous journey. Inside of this creature, a one Dr. Holden Clarke requests that the creature relax its grip and allow him to leave its clutches. The creature obliges, allowing the scientist to expose his apprehensive senses to this new world.        Dr. Clarke is a biologist and physicist who is now the first human to have transversed time and space using what many would consider a wormhole. He has done so with the cooperation of the creature, known as a Trilling (named so because of the high-pitched whirring noise it makes when it travels). Trillings are a species of highly intelligent and tremendously evolved insect-like creatures that came to Earth nearly a decade ago in search of uranium, an essential nutrient to their kind. The trillings offered their vastly superior knowledge in return for the energetic heavy metal. Accepting their offer, humanity established a harmonious, symbiotic relationship with the trillings and quickly set to the stars as their knowledge of the sciences was rapidly improved and expanded.        The scientist making this journey is the human lead of a coalition of scientists and engineers of both species who worked tirelessly to design a means of space travel that would harness the nature of space-time in such a way as to make distance meaningless. Both species concluded it was possible and now, a reality. The trilling in which Dr. Clarke partnered is named K’ke and having developed a telepathic understanding with each other as well as a remarkable friendship, the two have ripped a tunnel through space-time and landed on a planet in a virtually unknown solar system in the Andromeda Galaxy. It was determined to have a breathable atmosphere and this is true. It could not be determined what kind of life may be present on the planet and K’ke and Dr Clarke have quickly determined that it is hostile as they are attacked immediately upon landing. A creature the size of a yacht flew from the nearby forest at a sound-shattering speed and lodged itself into the side of K’ke. The creature resembles a white cockroach with white and black, octopus-like tentacles stretching from its underside. It begins lashing and grabbing at K’ke in an attempt to hook its tentacles into its fleshy eyelid. Dr Clarke emerges from beneath K’ke, seeing two other creatures flying towards them from a distance.K’ke let loose the motionless body of the Cuddle-Roach, tumbling and then sliding off the rocky outcropping to its forested grave below. The smell of the roach’s flesh and a brief multi-fabric spectral scan gleaned an astonishing fact to K’ke as the lifeless creature made its descent; it was techno-organic. K’ke quickly rationalized two scenarios under which such an organism would be at present attacking the duo; either the evolutionary circumstances by which this planet’s lifeforms have formed included such pressures that the creatures evolved to include technological features in an unprecedented and yet unseen aptitude of fitness, or there are or were a highly evolved and intelligent specie or species on this planet. K’ke relayed this information to Dr. Clarke in real-time through their telepathic link and both agreed upon their next course of action. Before the Posi-Gun could train on its next target, Holden gestured towards a glyph in the lower right of his RetMon that jarred in red panic and illuminated forbodence; he pressed the exclamation point enclosed in a circle.Dr Clarke’s suit immediately switched operating modes as his RetMon switched from a blue to red. His suit was now operating via radiobotics; specialized nano robots powered by radioisotopes. The circuitry of the suit shutdown allowing for the release of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that theoretically should stop or slow the attacks by the native aggressors and have no effect on the nano robots. Experimentation proves theory, as the two creatures are immobilized and crash into the hardened tar. The native creatures are hardly a thing of beauty, one looking something like a catfish with large, elephant-like ears, a flaccid wasp-like tail and a shimmering, amphibious tail. This creature is also outfitted with a set of wings that are made of a steel-like material and structured with many, independently movable propulsion cylinders and some wiring that led back to the creature's spine. The other resembles a ginger root with a brilliant orb of light and lengthy antenna sprouting from its head. Upon closer examination it can be seen that the body of this creature is covered with a multitude of tiny, hair-thin metal lances attached to spring mounted hinges.The professor and the Trilling traded physical and psychic glances in leap frogs as they moved to examine the creatures. Dr Clarke’s RetMon identified rapidly decreasing heat signatures in both lifeforms and neither engaged in any form of movement. There is no fucking way that we are looking at this right now; this looks natural! Holden thought to K’Ke, keeping silent should these creatures have friends who might wonder where they were off to. Indeed, hiding modifications such as these would require a breathtaking amount of scientific knowledge in what . . . seven disciplines, eight? K’ke responded with an equal amount of awe. Should we find that these creatures have evolved in this manner, everything we know about organic evolution will change. Jesus Christ . . . Holden trailed off and K’Ke thought: Such parlor tricks as his could never accomplish something as amazing as this. Their probing was interrupted when Dr. Clarke’s suit and RetMon began to flash with critical warnings in an eye-blistering orange. Radiation levels from the radiobots were near critical levels and threatening to permanently impact Holden’s health and well being. He quickly motioned to the invisible button with his hand, switching the suit back to standard operating mode, deactivating the radiobots in the process. Radiobotic technology is great for many things but is a short-lived luxury when humans are present; unless they are the type of humans one wishes not to be around for much longer. Strangely, the warning lights did not turn off; a moment later they heard it.        “She is demanding we come to her. Or else.” The or else was punctuated by an image ripped from deep within K’Ke’s mind. Rather than trying to explain it, K’Ke sent the entire idea at once.        It was a shared memory, a scene of devastation given to all Trillings when they reached adulthood: a vision of the 3 Harbingers. Captured by a survivor of The Hubris, who watched from rubble piles, as the Harbingers destroyed the ancient Trilling City of Yod.It was a vision of a pulsating black mass, its center like a sparking star. It sat upon the remnants of a huge black bridge. Re’Zed the Destroyer sat, swollen, Khan and Noz shrunken beneath.This was her threat to K’Ke. Come . . . or watch your world burn yet again.Dr. Clarke and K’Ke needed not to look at each other or even whisper their recommended course of action. The presence had her answer before the handshake of their telepathic link was complete. They would oblige this entity's request. Being both scientists and pragmatists, the search for knowledge was a calling that they further agreed was paramount to their lives. This extortion could end in a most terribly life-concluding way but at least Dr. Clarke’s suit was recording every moment of their journey and being sent in real time back to Earth, though its travel time was considerable. Should their life’s end on this planet under the guises of a being of incredible power, the paragraph regarding their radical maiden voyage in the history books and the tremendous telemetry that would be amassed was enough for either of them to die victorious.The entity was satisfied that the two were willing to entertain her demands and as a gesture of her intended cooperative dominance quickly architected a form that was a composite of what Dr. Clarke and K’Ke would consider attractive. The form coerced from the deepest subconscious dreams of the two travelers was something of inexplicable beauty. She materialized at 178 centimeters in height and a lithe 180 kilograms. Her eyes were enormous black spheres and looking into them was like seeing the mysteries of the universe unravel in front of you. They reflected not an empty black but a finely engraved network of points and lines. It was easy to get lost in the three-dimensional maze of her eyes. They were certainly of an insectoid origin as was her mouth. It was vertically oriented and formed from a small jawlike hinge set just below her eyes. When she smiled (in what looked nothing like a human or Triling smile) the jaw would open slightly revealing a soft, moist gumline surrounding both sides of her jaw. There were no teeth, instead two tendrils attached on either side of her tongue would extend out and delicately bat the air. The ends of these tendrils appeared as thin, layered wafers of muscle or tendon. Her tongue was sharp and forked and could extend to her knees. She had flowing black hair that shimmered with a prismatic, iridescent sheen as light passed over it. At the height of her shoulders were two wings that hung like a cape and reached to her heels. She could manipulate them with ease, wrapping them around her body and then extending them for flight in a demonstration of their versatility. They were mesmerizing to look at, a sheer network of crystalline structures that looked like faintly tinted glass and held in place by thin, pink cartilage The wings did not reflect light no matter their contortion, a property of the invisibility that they could grant. Her arms were akin to a human except with four joints along its length. Her hands resembled those of a frog, having flat pads at the end of each of her six fingers. Her hands appeared to be wet or lubricated at all times. Her torso was narrow and adorned with a set of human-like breasts that were perky and voluptuous. Her breasts appeared like that of a human’s save for each areola harbored two nipples. That is where the similarity stopped, however, as she revealed that each set of nipples could open into a narrow, moist canal not unlike a vagina and she further demonstrated that she could stick the forked sides of her tongue out of her nipples from within her mouth. She walked in a bipedal manner although she was actually a quadruped whose legs formed two interlocking sets. Her legs were nimble, elegant, and sleek with joints in six places allowing for incredible agility and speed when moving on four legs. Her feet were narrow and small with a fine, retractable filament that could be extended from her two toes or heel to aid in climbing, balancing, etc. Her skin was a milky white throughout with a healthy, rosy hue that exuded health and fertility. The pure beauty of the creature that stood before them was enough to make even the stoutest of hearts bend but was all but a cover for what formed between her four legs.She lifted her wings into a sort of canopy above her head, reared back on two of her legs and lifted the other two in the air. Her frog-like fingers crept down to exhibit the sexual organ that she had conjured. She fanned her hands outwards revealing a series of thin, pink, layered labia, some twenty on each side of her genitalia. She would play with them by delicately fanning them back and forth and as she did each would emit a tone that sounded like a bar on a wind chime at a very low volume. Fanning these folds would emit hypnotic harmonies and chordal structures meant for seducing her intended partner. The notes would rise and fall in pitch concurrent with her state of arousal. Between these delicate, ephemeral folds were her primary labia which she could retract and extend with the same flexibility as her wings. The travelers watched as she quickly demonstrated by fanning out her fingers and extending her labia outwards so that each finger was individually covered by the dripping wet fold. She then twisted the pink labia so that they ‘licked’ each of her fingers in a twisting flicking motion that left them covered in her body's lubricating substance before retracting back to their resting position. Inside her primary labia and at the front of her birth canal was a hybrid clitoris and secondary labia. The organ resembled the head of a penis on a human male or a cervix on a female, with a dripping tight entry that could be opened and closed at will, twisting the secondary labia in an interconnected series of muscle contractions, akin to the shutter on a camera. She was able to extend the canal from within her such that it resembled a human’s erect penis but with girth enough to be penetrated. At the base of this appendage were two round folds covered with numerous round bumps. She opened these towards the travelers to show that they would vibrate at incredible speeds at her will; Dr. Clarke surmised that these were some sort of testicle pillows designed to stimulate as she was penetrated. She dropped her legs and composed herself into the well postured, omnipotent being that she was and smiled her strange vertical smile at them.“I can tell by your state of arousal that this is an exceedingly suitable form in which you will engage in intercourse. Very good then, follow me.” The RetMon easily translated the creature's language for Dr. Clarke and K’ke needed no translation as he spoke the ancient dialect of the language which she used. K’ke explained to Holden that the language was simply called 27-3 by his people as it was the third of eight discovered within the 27th star system that the Trillings had investigated. It was quite old indeed and not something that this entity would have any need for given the power she posessed, explained K’Ke, noting that it was suspicious that she should know this language.She turned and formed an electric, blue portal and beaconed for them to follow as she disappeared into.“So, you know she’s just using you to get to me, right K’ke?” Dr. Clarke quips and looks over at his friend with a wry smirk.“I will let you know, human, that the things that this girl was putting in my mind would turn you into a quivering, imbecilic lump of twitching flesh and drool from which you could never return. Trillings have a saying, ‘if a lover is fast, go faster; if a lover is cold, grow colder; if a lover is wanting, be the first to giving.’ I can see no practical means by which you will prevent me from being first, Holden.”Holden was already running for the portal. This is a game the two scientists play in that they already know each other’s thoughts without need to speak but pretend as if they don’t so they can have conversations as if they were both human. It is an ongoing cultural investigatory tool for K’ke, who casually follows Holden into the portal.        Travel through the portal nearly felt antiquated to Dr, Clarke and K’ke. The two have been dematerialized and reassembled countless times but only once have they traveled directly through the universe instead of beside it. Although both are well traveled, neither was expecting what was on the other side of the portal. They materialized on a low sloping foothill at the base of a collection of narrow, rocky buttes that appeared of volcanic origin. The foothill gradually moved towards a tumultuous river and on the other side was a small agrarian village. Holden’s suit indicated that they were on the same planet but nearly on the opposing side from where they had landed. To the left or what would be east of the portal and virtually undetectable save for the soft rustling of grass and a faint whine was a large, sleeping green mouse tucked up against the jagged rocks. Its fur was indistinguishable from common grass and weeds and it slept in the open knowing that few creatures could ever detect it. It looked to weigh nearly 1,000 kilograms.On the foothill on the southside of the village was a bushy crop not unlike coffee but with large, thick, and sharp leaves. Numerous humanoid workers frantically and nervously tended to the crops, some picking beans, others pruning, and still others hauling the crop back to the village. K’ke and Holden found the queen atop a large, green animal that resembled a tiger but had skin like a reptile. She motioned behind them and up the crag where a large, owl-like creature and a slender, dark cat sat and stared intently at the skies above. There amidst the clouds and light of the day was an entity of darkness and hunger. Its amber eyes peered through the veil of shadow as it swiftly harpooned a portion of the butte with a white, metallic machine with a thin blade that penetrated and cut away a portion of the rock. The entity inhaled and a vortex of rock, sand, and dust spun upward and disappeared into the dark mass of the entity. The queen motioned for them to follow and spoke to their minds, “this is not our battle, our destination is beyond.” Their goal was quickly unveiled as they reached the river and looked east to see a facility constructed at the top of another rocky crag with an intricately carved sculpture of something like a dragon carved directly into the rocks below.
